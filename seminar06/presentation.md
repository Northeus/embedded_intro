# ADC

---

# Agenda
 1. Intro to ADC
 1. Assignment for simple PIC project
 1. Planning of next seminars

---

# ADC
 - World around us is heavily dependent on analog values
 - Examples: headphones, Wify, and VGA
 - Instead of 0 and 1, we have range of values
 - Signal can be sampled and digitized

---

# Prepare project
 - Open your projects
 - Copy and paste [main.c](https://github.com/Northeus/embedded_intro/tree/master/seminar06/code/main.c)
 - Check the project together

---

# Useful stuff
 - [Datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/40001412G.pdf)
 - [Board schematic](https://github.com/Northeus/embedded_intro/tree/master/seminar02/schematic.pdf)
 - This project uses button as input not reset (see datasheet for MCLR pin)

---

# Assignment (pair programming)
 1. Find a "TODO" comment
 1. Implement the thing mentioned in that comment
 1. Note the index of the comment to the top comment
 1. Repeat if there is still some unresolved "TODO" comment

---

# Next seminars
 - We have 4 left seminars
 - We will switch to a new board and re-learn some stuff
 - The last (possibly last two) seminars will use NXP CUP cars
